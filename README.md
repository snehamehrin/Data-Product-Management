# Building an end-to-end product launch using data analytics and UX research


## Overview

This project showcases how as a data product manager you can bring    **flying tax servic**e to New York by analyzing  **market data** and building a  **product proposal**.

In the second part of the project, I should came up with a  **scalable data strategy** to address the  **massive amount of data**  and also process it to get the  **business insights**  they need to run and  **grow the business.**

And finally, I   **selected KPIs**  and tested previous  **multivariate experiment results**;  **perform funnel and cohort analyses**; come up with a  **hypothesis**  and next steps.

This case study is presented in the form of a series of articles

**Motivation**
The intersection of **Product Management** and **Data Analytics** is one of my key research areas now.  I think key to building products that people love is to  incorporate  **user research**,  **behavioral science**, and  **data analytics** into  **product management** .
